## 1. Authentication vs Authorization?

### Authentication
**→ Who you are**

- **Verifies identity** of the user
- Answers: "Are you who you say you are?"
- Examples: Login, Password, Biometrics, OTP

### Authorization
**→ What you can access**

- **Verifies permissions** of the user
- Answers: "Are you allowed to do this?"
- Examples: Roles, Permissions, Policies

## 2. What is JWT Token?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a **self-contained token** used for **stateless authentication** between client and server.

## 3. What is CORS?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** allows or restricts **cross-origin requests** between frontend and backend domains.
