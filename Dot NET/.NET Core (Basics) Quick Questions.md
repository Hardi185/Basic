## 1. What is CLR?

**CLR (Common Language Runtime)** executes .NET code, manages memory, garbage collection, and exceptions.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Code execution
- Memory management
- Garbage collection
- Exception handling
- Type safety
- Security

## 2. SDK vs Runtime?

| SDK | Runtime |
|-----|---------|
| **Build, run, and develop apps** | **Only run existing apps** |
| Includes compiler, tools, libraries | Only includes execution engine |
| Required for developers | Required for end users |
| Larger in size | Smaller in size |

### Example:
- **Developer machine** → Needs SDK
- **Production server** → Needs only Runtime

## 3. What is Kestrel?

**Kestrel** is a **cross-platform web server** used by ASP.NET Core to handle HTTP requests.

### Key Features:
- Lightweight and fast
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Can run standalone or behind a reverse proxy (IIS, Nginx, Apache)
- Default web server in ASP.NET Core

### Architecture:
```
Client Request
      ↓
Reverse Proxy (IIS/Nginx) [Optional]
      ↓
Kestrel
      ↓
ASP.NET Core App
```

## 4. Program.cs & Startup.cs / Minimal Hosting

- 	Before .NET 6
        - Program.cs → App startup
        - Startup.cs → Services & middleware
-	.NET 6+
        - Everything is in Program.cs (minimal hosting model)

## 5. Is .NET Core cross-platform? How?
Yes. It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS because it uses a platform-independent CLR and runtime.
