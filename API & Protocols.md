# What is an API?

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. 
```yaml
Think of it like a intermediate between client & server.
Takes request sends to server, takes the response sends to client.
```

- APIs can be either stateless or stateful, depending on how they manage client-server interactions.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Stateless APIs (Most Common)

- The server does not store any client-specific session data.
- Each request from the client must contain all necessary information (e.g., authentication tokens, parameters).
- Example: REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) are stateless.
- Benefits:
  ‚úÖ Scalable, as each request is independent.
  ‚úÖ Easier to cache responses.
  ‚úÖ More resilient to failures.

- Example of a Stateless API (RESTful API Request)

````yaml
GET /user/123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
````

- The server processes this request without remembering past interactions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stateful APIs

- The server stores client session data between requests.
- The client must maintain the same session (e.g., cookies, session IDs).
- Example: SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol) and WebSockets.
- Use cases: Banking transactions, real-time applications, multi-step processes.
- Example of a Stateful API (Session-Based Login)

````yaml
POST /login
{
  "username": "user123",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
````

- The server responds with a session ID that must be used in future requests.


## Types of APIs

- REST API (Representational State Transfer)
  - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Works with JSON or XML data.
  - Stateless, meaning each request is independent.
  - Example: Fetching user data from a web service.
    
- SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)

  - Uses XML-based messaging format.
  - More secure and reliable than REST.
  - Requires more bandwidth and is slower than REST.
  - Used in banking and enterprise applications.

- GraphQL API

  - Allows clients to request only the data they need.
  - More efficient than REST (reduces over-fetching of data).
  - Used by Facebook, GitHub, and modern web apps.

- WebSocket API

  - Provides real-time communication (full-duplex).
  - Used for chat applications, live stock updates, gaming, etc.
  - Faster than REST for real-time data transfer.

## üåê HTTP vs HTTPS - Key Differences & Security

The main difference between **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is **security**. HTTPS provides encrypted communication using **SSL/TLS**, making it more secure than HTTP.


### üîπ Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS

| Feature          | HTTP  | HTTPS  |
|-----------------|------|--------|
| **Security**    | ‚ùå Not secure | ‚úÖ Secure (uses SSL/TLS encryption) |
| **Data Encryption** | ‚ùå No encryption (plain text data) | ‚úÖ Encrypted with SSL/TLS |
| **Data Integrity** | ‚ùå Can be modified (MITM attacks) | ‚úÖ Prevents data tampering |
| **Authentication** | ‚ùå No identity verification | ‚úÖ Uses SSL certificates for verification |
| **Port Used** | 80 | 443 |
| **Performance** | ‚ö° Faster (no encryption overhead) | üõ° Slightly slower due to encryption but optimized with HTTP/2 |


### üîπ How HTTPS is More Secure?

#### üîí **Encryption**  
HTTPS encrypts data using **SSL/TLS**, preventing hackers from stealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card details).  

#### üõ° **Data Integrity**  
- Ensures that data is not altered or corrupted during transfer.  
- Detects if someone attempts to modify data in transit.  

#### ‚úÖ **Authentication**  
- Uses **SSL certificates** to verify the website‚Äôs authenticity.  
- Prevents phishing attacks by ensuring users connect to the correct server.  

#### üåç **SEO & Trust**  
- Google ranks HTTPS websites **higher** in search results.  
- Users trust HTTPS sites more (padlock icon üîí in the browser).  


### üîπ When to Use HTTP vs. HTTPS?

‚úî **Use HTTP** for **public, non-sensitive content** (e.g., blogs, news).  
‚úî **Use HTTPS** for **secure communication** (e.g., login pages, payment processing, confidential data transfer).
