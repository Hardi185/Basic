## What is an API?

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. 
```yaml
Think of it like a intermediate between client & server.
Takes request sends to server, takes the response sends to client.
```

## Stateless vs Stateful APIs
- APIs can be either stateless or stateful, depending on how they manage client-server interactions.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Stateless APIs (Most Common)

- The server does not store any client-specific session data.
- Each request from the client must contain all necessary information (e.g., authentication tokens, parameters).
- Example: REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) are stateless.
- Benefits:

  ‚úî Scalable, as each request is independent.
  
  ‚úî Easier to cache responses.
  
  ‚úî More resilient to failures.

- Example of a Stateless API (RESTful API Request)

````yaml
GET /user/123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
````

- The server processes this request without remembering past interactions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stateful APIs

- The server stores client session data between requests.
- The client must maintain the same session (e.g., cookies, session IDs).
- Example: SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol) and WebSockets.
- Use cases: Banking transactions, real-time applications, multi-step processes.
- Example of a Stateful API (Session-Based Login)

````yaml
POST /login
{
  "username": "user123",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
````

- The server responds with a session ID that must be used in future requests.


## Types of APIs

- REST API (Representational State Transfer)
  - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Works with JSON or XML data.
  - Stateless, meaning each request is independent.
  - Example: Fetching user data from a web service.
    
- SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)

  - Uses XML-based messaging format.
  - More secure and reliable than REST.
  - Requires more bandwidth and is slower than REST.
  - Used in banking and enterprise applications.

- GraphQL API

  - Allows clients to request only the data they need.
  - More efficient than REST (reduces over-fetching of data).
  - Used by Facebook, GitHub, and modern web apps.

- WebSocket API

  - Provides real-time communication (full-duplex).
  - Used for chat applications, live stock updates, gaming, etc.
  - Faster than REST for real-time data transfer.

## üåê HTTP vs HTTPS - Key Differences & Security

The main difference between **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is **security**. HTTPS provides encrypted communication using **SSL/TLS**, making it more secure than HTTP.


### üîπ Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS

| Feature          | HTTP  | HTTPS  |
|-----------------|------|--------|
| **Security**    | ‚ùå Not secure | ‚úÖ Secure (uses SSL/TLS encryption) |
| **Data Encryption** | ‚ùå No encryption (plain text data) | ‚úÖ Encrypted with SSL/TLS |
| **Data Integrity** | ‚ùå Can be modified (MITM attacks) | ‚úÖ Prevents data tampering |
| **Authentication** | ‚ùå No identity verification | ‚úÖ Uses SSL certificates for verification |
| **Port Used** | 80 | 443 |
| **Performance** | ‚ö° Faster (no encryption overhead) | üõ° Slightly slower due to encryption but optimized with HTTP/2 |


### üîπ How HTTPS is More Secure?

#### üîí **Encryption**  
HTTPS encrypts data using **SSL/TLS**, preventing hackers from stealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card details).  

#### üõ° **Data Integrity**  
- Ensures that data is not altered or corrupted during transfer.  
- Detects if someone attempts to modify data in transit.  

#### ‚úÖ **Authentication**  
- Uses **SSL certificates** to verify the website‚Äôs authenticity.  
- Prevents phishing attacks by ensuring users connect to the correct server.  

#### üåç **SEO & Trust**  
- Google ranks HTTPS websites **higher** in search results.  
- Users trust HTTPS sites more (padlock icon üîí in the browser).  


### üîπ When to Use HTTP vs. HTTPS?

‚úî **Use HTTP** for **public, non-sensitive content** (e.g., blogs, news).  
‚úî **Use HTTPS** for **secure communication** (e.g., login pages, payment processing, confidential data transfer).

## Common HTTP Response Status Codes Returned by APIs

When an API responds to a request, it includes an HTTP status code to indicate the outcome. Here are the most commonly used response codes:

### ‚úÖ 1xx ‚Äì Informational Responses (Rarely Used)
| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **100** | Continue | Server received request headers and client should proceed. |
| **101** | Switching Protocols | Server is switching protocols (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket). |

### ‚úÖ 2xx ‚Äì Success Responses
| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **200** | OK | Request was successful, and response contains data. |
| **201** | Created | Resource was successfully created (e.g., after `POST`). |
| **202** | Accepted | Request was accepted for processing but not yet completed. |
| **204** | No Content | Request succeeded, but no response body is returned. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3xx ‚Äì Redirection Responses
| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **301** | Moved Permanently | Resource URL has changed permanently. |
| **302** | Found | Temporary redirection to another URL. |
| **304** | Not Modified | Resource hasn‚Äôt changed (used for caching). |

### ‚õî 4xx ‚Äì Client Errors
| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Request is invalid (e.g., missing parameters, incorrect format). |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Authentication is required but missing or invalid. |
| **403** | Forbidden | Client is authenticated but doesn‚Äôt have permission. |
| **404** | Not Found | Requested resource doesn‚Äôt exist. |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) is not allowed on this endpoint. |
| **409** | Conflict | Request conflicts with the current state (e.g., duplicate resource). |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limiting: Client has sent too many requests. |

### ‚ùå 5xx ‚Äì Server Errors
| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Generic error when something goes wrong on the server. |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | Server received an invalid response from an upstream service. |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | Server is temporarily unavailable (e.g., overloaded, maintenance). |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | Server didn‚Äôt receive a response from an upstream service in time. |
