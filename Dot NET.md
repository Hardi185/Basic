# .NET Framework and ASP.NET Overview

## What is .NET Framework?
.NET is a free, open-source developer platform created by Microsoft for building various types of applications. With .NET, developers can use multiple programming languages, editors, and libraries to create applications for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT. Initially released in the early 2000s, .NET has evolved into a versatile platform with a wide range of tools, frameworks, and languages.
