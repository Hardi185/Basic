# Angular Overview

## What is Angular?

Angular is a platform and framework that allows us to build client-side applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**.

## Main Features of Angular

1. **Two-Way Data Binding**
   - Sync data between the model and the view automatically, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other.

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Efficiently manages and injects dependencies, enhancing modularity and simplifying testing.

3. **Component-Based Approach**
   - Breaks down the application into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale.

4. **Templating with Directives**
   - Angular provides powerful directives such as:
     - `*ngFor`: Used for iterating over a collection.
     - `*ngIf`: Conditionally displays elements.
     - `*ngSwitch`: Handles conditional rendering based on multiple conditions.

5. **RESTful API Handling**
   - Simplifies interaction with RESTful services and APIs using tools like the `HttpClient` module.

6. **Lazy Loading**
   - Delays the loading of modules until they are required, reducing the initial bundle size and improving application performance.
